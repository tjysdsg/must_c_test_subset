ted_01096_0015990_0020120 back in new york i am the head of development for a nonprofit called robin hood
ted_01096_0020290_0025450 when i &apos;m not fighting poverty i &apos;m fighting fires as the assistant captain of a volunteer fire company
ted_01096_0025930_0034040 now in our town where the volunteers supplement a highly skilled career staff you have to get to the fire scene pretty early to get in on any action
ted_01096_0034920_0036480 i remember my first fire
ted_01096_0036730_0040910 i was the second volunteer on the scene so there was a pretty good chance i was going to get in
ted_01096_0041880_0047460 but still it was a real footrace against the other volunteers to get to the captain in charge to find out what our assignments would be
ted_01096_0048310_0056920 when i found the captain he was having a very engaging conversation with the homeowner who was surely having one of the worst days of her life
ted_01096_0057510_0067190 here it was the middle of the night she was standing outside in the pouring rain under an umbrella in her pajamas barefoot while her house was in flames
ted_01096_0068550_0086890 the other volunteer who had arrived just before me let &apos;s call him lex luther laughter got to the captain first and was asked to go inside and save the homeowner &apos;s dog the dog i was stunned with jealousy
ted_01096_0087110_0097460 here was some lawyer or money manager who for the rest of his life gets to tell people that he went into a burning building to save a living creature just because he beat me by five seconds
ted_01096_0097550_0099600 well i was next
ted_01096_0100210_0101630 the captain waved me over
ted_01096_0101640_0104550 he said bezos i need you to go into the house
ted_01096_0104730_0114070 i need you to go upstairs past the fire and i need you to get this woman a pair of shoes laughter i swear
ted_01096_0115530_0129520 so not exactly what i was hoping for but off i went up the stairs down the hall past the &apos; real &apos; firefighters who were pretty much done putting out the fire at this point into the master bedroom to get a pair of shoes
ted_01096_0129540_0145960 now i know what you &apos;re thinking but i &apos;m no hero laughter i carried my payload back downstairs where i met my nemesis and the precious dog by the front door
ted_01096_0147260_0154680 we took our treasures outside to the homeowner where not surprisingly his received much more attention than did mine
ted_01096_0155630_0161670 a few weeks later the department received a letter from the homeowner thanking us for the valiant effort displayed in saving her home
ted_01096_0162550_0168470 the act of kindness she noted above all others someone had even gotten her a pair of shoes
ted_01096_0170420_0183730 in both my vocation at robin hood and my avocation as a volunteer firefighter i am witness to acts of generosity and kindness on a monumental scale but i &apos;m also witness to acts of grace and courage on an individual basis
ted_01096_0184310_0198730 and you know what i &apos;ve learned they all matter so as i look around this room at people who either have achieved or are on their way to achieving remarkable levels of success i would offer this reminder don &apos;t wait
ted_01096_0200420_0203470 don &apos;t wait until you make your first million to make a difference in somebody &apos;s life
ted_01096_0203740_0206550 if you have something to give give it now
ted_01096_0207610_0211900 serve food at a soup kitchen clean up a neighborhood park be a mentor
ted_01096_0212760_0219790 not every day is going to offer us a chance to save somebody &apos;s life but every day offers us an opportunity to affect one
ted_01096_0220280_0222720 so get in the game save the shoes
ted_01096_0223280_0249220 thank you
ted_01096_0249270_0271550 bruno giussani mark mark come back
ted_01096_0271720_0274090 mark bezos thank you
ted_01102_0016180_0020350 i just came back from a community that holds the secret to human survival
ted_01102_0021750_0031230 it &apos;s a place where women run the show have sex to say hello and play rules the day where fun is serious business
ted_01102_0031740_0040200 and no this isn &apos;t burning man or san francisco laughter ladies and gentlemen meet your cousins
ted_01102_0040900_0044620 this is the world of wild bonobos in the jungles of congo
ted_01102_0045540_0051360 bonobos are together with chimpanzees your living closest relative
ted_01102_0052040_0059030 that means we all share a common ancestor an evolutionary grandmother who lived around six million years ago
ted_01102_0060610_0064590 now chimpanzees are wellknown for their aggression
ted_01102_0068520_0075340 but unfortunately we have made too much of an emphasis of this aspect in our narratives of human evolution
ted_01102_0076980_0090000 but bonobos show us the other side of the coin while chimpanzees are dominated by big scary guys bonobo society is run by empowered females
ted_01102_0091710_0101580 these guys have really worked something out since this leads to a highly tolerant society where fatal violence has not been observed yet
ted_01102_0103410_0107800 but unfortunately bonobos are the least understood of the great apes
ted_01102_0108610_0114730 they live in the depths of the congolese jungle and it has been very difficult to study them
ted_01102_0115280_0135110 the congo is a paradox a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty but also the heart of darkness itself the scene of a violent conflict that has raged for decades and claimed nearly as many lives as the first world war
ted_01102_0136980_0142360 not surprisingly this destruction also endangers bonobo survival
ted_01102_0143140_0153490 bushmeat trades and forest loss means we couldn &apos;t fill a small stadium with all the bonobos that are left in the world and we &apos;re not even sure of that to be honest
ted_01102_0154890_0163040 yet in this land of violence and chaos you can hear hidden laughter swaying the trees
ted_01102_0163680_0178100 who are these cousins we know them as the make love not war apes since they have frequent promiscuous and bisexual sex to manage conflict and solve social issues
ted_01102_0178510_0187830 now i &apos;m not saying this is the solution to all of humanity &apos;s problems since there &apos;s more to bonobo life than the kama sutra
ted_01102_0189190_0192400 bonobos like humans love to play throughout their entire lives
ted_01102_0192970_0194930 play is not just child &apos;s games
ted_01102_0195440_0200920 for us and them play is foundational for bonding relationships and fostering tolerance
ted_01102_0201630_0205540 it &apos;s where we learn to trust and where we learn about the rules of the game
ted_01102_0206990_0220460 play increases creativity and resilience and it &apos;s all about the generation of diversity diversity of interactions diversity of behaviors diversity of connections
ted_01102_0222180_0230040 and when you watch bonobo play you &apos;re seeing the very evolutionary roots of human laughter dance and ritual
ted_01102_0231180_0233940 play is the glue that binds us together
ted_01102_0235260_0241930 now i don &apos;t know how you play but i want to show you a couple of unique clips fresh from the wild
ted_01102_0242310_0247320 first it &apos;s a ball game bonobostyle and i do not mean football
ted_01102_0247890_0253560 so here we have a young female and a male engaged in a chase game
ted_01102_0254370_0255740 have a look what she &apos;s doing
ted_01102_0256540_0266500 it might be the evolutionary origin of the phrase she &apos;s got him by the balls laughter only i think that he &apos;s rather loving it here right
ted_01102_0268310_0274990 yeah laughter so sex play is common in both bonobos and humans
ted_01102_0276150_0297450 and this video is really interesting because it shows this video &apos;s really interesting because it shows the inventiveness of bringing unusual elements into play such as testicles and also how play both requires trust and fosters trust while at the same time being tremendous fun
ted_01102_0298230_0313750 but play &apos;s a shapeshifter laughter play &apos;s a shapeshifter and it can take many forms some of which are more quiet imaginative curious maybe where wonder is discovered anew
ted_01102_0314300_0319400 and i want you to see this is fuku a young female and she is quietly playing with water
ted_01102_0320460_0327250 i think like her we sometimes play alone and we explore the boundaries of our inner and our outer worlds
ted_01102_0328730_0340080 and it &apos;s that playful curiosity that drives us to explore drives us to interact and then the unexpected connections we form are the real hotbed for creativity
ted_01102_0341720_0348580 so these are just small tasters into the insights that bonobo give us to our past and present
ted_01102_0349370_0360560 but they also hold a secret for our future a future where we need to adapt to an increasingly challenging world through greater creativity and greater cooperation
ted_01102_0361500_0366200 the secret is that play is the key to these capacities
ted_01102_0366940_0370220 in other words play is our adaptive wildcard
ted_01102_0371100_0375980 in order to adapt successfully to a changing world we need to play
ted_01102_0378580_0381780 but will we make the most of our playfulness
ted_01102_0382280_0390800 play is not frivolous play &apos;s essential for bonobos and humans alike life is not just red in tooth and claw
ted_01102_0391680_0397450 in times when it seems least appropriate to play it might be the times when it is most urgent
ted_01102_0398640_0412100 and so my fellow primates let us embrace this gift from evolution and play together as we rediscover creativity fellowship and wonder
ted_01102_0412250_0412730 thank you
ted_01104_0016270_0032250 i want you now to imagine a wearable robot that gives you superhuman abilities or another one that takes wheelchair users up standing and walking again
ted_01104_0033950_0039370 we at berkeley bionics call these robots exoskeletons
ted_01104_0041160_0056440 these are nothing else than something that you put on in the morning and it will give you extra strength and it will further enhance your speed and it will help you for instance to manage your balance
ted_01104_0057280_0062670 it is actually the true integration of the man and the machine
ted_01104_0063340_0070470 but not only that it will integrate and network you to the universe and other devices out there
ted_01104_0071170_0073300 this is just not some blue sky thinking
ted_01104_0073530_0087340 to show you now what we are working on by starting out talking about the american soldier that on average does carry about 100 lbs on their backs and they are being asked to carry more equipment
ted_01104_0088330_0098530 obviously this is resulting in some major complications back injuries 30 percent of them chronic back injuries
ted_01104_0098930_0107810 so we thought we would look at this challenge and create an exoskeleton that would help deal with this issue
ted_01104_0109030_0116630 so let me now introduce to you hulc or the human universal load carrier
ted_01104_0118500_0123190 soldier with the hulc exoskeleton i can carry 200 lbs over varied terrain for many hours
ted_01104_0123560_0128710 its flexible design allows for deep squats crawls and highagility movements
ted_01104_0129290_0134320 it senses what i want to do where i want to go and then augments my strength and endurance
ted_01104_0135670_0144880 eythor bender we are ready with our industry partner to introduce this device this new exoskeleton this year
ted_01104_0145530_0146420 so this is for real
ted_01104_0147640_0155560 now let &apos;s turn our heads towards the wheelchair users something that i &apos;m particularly passionate about
ted_01104_0156780_0161400 there are 68 million people estimated to be in wheelchairs worldwide
ted_01104_0161950_0165100 this is about one percent of the total population
ted_01104_0165160_0167300 and that &apos;s actually a conservative estimate
ted_01104_0167840_0179890 we are talking here about oftentimes very young individuals with spinal cord injuries that in the prime of their life 20s 30s 40s hit a wall and the wheelchair &apos;s the only option
ted_01104_0180140_0183870 but it is also the aging population that is multiplying in numbers
ted_01104_0184490_0192100 and the only option pretty much when it &apos;s stroke or other complications is the wheelchair
ted_01104_0192100_0198460 and that is actually for the last 500 years since its very successful introduction i must say
ted_01104_0200250_0206280 so we thought we would start writing a brand new chapter of mobility
ted_01104_0207920_0224790 let me now introduce you to elegs that is worn by amanda boxtel that 19 years ago was spinal cord injured and as a result of that she has not been able to walk for 19 years until now
ted_01104_0235830_0236360 amanda boxtel thank you
ted_01104_0236530_0252090 eb amanda is wearing our elegs set it has sensors it &apos;s completely noninvasive sensors in the crutches that send signals back to our onboard computer that is sitting here at her back
ted_01104_0252870_0265600 there are battery packs here as well that power motors that are sitting at her hips as well as her knee joints that move her forward in this kind of smooth and very natural gait
ted_01104_0265790_0277500 ab i was 24 years old and at the top of my game when a freak summersault while downhill skiing paralyzed me
ted_01104_0278130_0284580 in a split second i lost all sensation and movement below my pelvis
ted_01104_0285800_0299410 not long afterwards a doctor strode into my hospital room and he said amanda you &apos;ll never walk again and that was 19 yeas ago
ted_01104_0300400_0304880 he robbed every ounce of hope from my being
ted_01104_0305870_0314010 adaptive technology has since enabled me to learn how to downhill ski again to rock climb and even handcycle
ted_01104_0314050_0322480 but nothing has been invented that enables me to walk until now
ted_01104_0330955_0331155 thank you
ted_01104_0336350_0344170 eb as you can see we have the technology we have the platforms to sit down and have discussions with you
ted_01104_0345470_0363440 it &apos;s in our hands and we have all the potential here to change the lives of future generations not only for the soldiers or for amanda here and all the wheelchair users but for everyone
ted_01104_0365850_0366110 ab thanks
ted_01104_0376370_0376570 applause
ted_01114_0016150_0025320 i have spent the past few years putting myself into situations that are usually very difficult and at the same time somewhat dangerous
ted_01114_0025840_0029690 i went to prison difficult
ted_01114_0030880_0034350 i worked in a coal mine dangerous
ted_01114_0035650_0039040 i filmed in war zones difficult and dangerous
ted_01114_0040170_0048760 and i spent 30 days eating nothing but this fun in the beginning little difficult in the middle very dangerous in the end
ted_01114_0050480_0068200 in fact most of my career i &apos;ve been immersing myself into seemingly horrible situations for the whole goal of trying to examine societal issues in a way that make them engaging that make them interesting that hopefully break them down in a way that make them entertaining and accessible to an audience
ted_01114_0068640_0075540 so when i knew i was coming here to do a ted talk that was going to look at the world of branding and sponsorship i knew i would want to do something a little different
ted_01114_0076100_0080930 so as some of you may or may not have heard a couple weeks ago i took out an ad on ebay
ted_01114_0082060_0114610 i sent out some facebook messages some twitter messages and i gave people the opportunity to buy the naming rights to my 2011 ted talk laughter that &apos;s right some lucky individual corporation forprofit or nonprofit was going to get the onceinalifetime opportunity because i &apos;m sure chris anderson will never let it happen again laughter to buy the naming rights to the talk you &apos;re watching right now that at the time didn &apos;t have a title didn &apos;t really have a lot of content and didn &apos;t really give much hint as to what the subject matter would actually be
ted_01114_0115650_0129110 so what you were getting was this your name here presents my ted talk that you have no idea what the subject is and depending on the content could ultimately blow up in your face especially if i make you or your company look stupid for doing it
ted_01114_0129130_0154150 but that being said it &apos;s a very good media opportunity laughter you know how many people watch these ted talks it &apos;s a lot that &apos;s just a working title by the way laughter so even with that caveat i knew that someone would buy the naming rights
ted_01114_0154180_0157370 now if you &apos;d have asked me that a year ago i wouldn &apos;t have been able to tell you that with any certainty
ted_01114_0157870_0162050 but in the new project that i &apos;m working on my new film we examine the world of marketing advertising
ted_01114_0163370_0185120 and as i said earlier i put myself in some pretty horrible situations over the years but nothing could prepare me nothing could ready me for anything as difficult or as dangerous as going into the rooms with these guys laughter you see i had this idea for a movie
ted_01114_0185130_0194280 video morgan spurlock what i want to do is make a film all about product placement marketing and advertising where the entire film is funded by product placement marketing and advertising
ted_01114_0194740_0215390 so the movie will be called the greatest movie ever sold so what happens in the greatest movie ever sold is that everything from top to bottom from start to finish is branded from beginning to end from the abovethetitle sponsor that you &apos;ll see in the movie which is brand x now this brand the qualcomm stadium the staples center these people will be married to the film in perpetuity forever
ted_01114_0215760_0219820 and so the film explores this whole idea michael kassan it &apos;s redundant it &apos;s what mk it &apos;s redundant in perpetuity forever
ted_01114_0220550_0223890 i &apos;m a redundant person mk i &apos;m just saying that was more for emphasis
ted_01114_0224300_0231100 it was in perpetuity forever but not only are we going to have the brand x title sponsor but we &apos;re going to make sure we sell out every category we can in the film
ted_01114_0231230_0239830 so maybe we sell a shoe and it becomes the greatest shoe you ever wore the greatest car you ever drove from the greatest movie ever sold the greatest drink you &apos;ve ever had courtesy of the greatest movie ever sold
ted_01114_0239860_0246580 xavier kochhar so the idea is beyond just showing that brands are a part of your life but actually get them to finance the film ms get them to finance the film
ted_01114_0246590_0248700 ms and actually we show the whole process of how does it work
ted_01114_0248710_0250620 the goal of this whole film is transparency
ted_01114_0250820_0253070 you &apos;re going to see the whole thing take place in this movie
ted_01114_0253180_0256680 so that &apos;s the whole concept the whole film start to finish
ted_01114_0256950_0258930 and i would love for ceg to help make it happen
ted_01114_0259620_0266480 robert friedman you know it &apos;s funny because when i first hear it it is the ultimate respect for an audience
ted_01114_0266500_0270840 guy i don &apos;t know how receptive people are going to be to it though
ted_01114_0271020_0277830 xk do you have a perspective i don &apos;t want to use angle because that has a negative connotation but do you know how this is going to play out ms no idea
ted_01114_0278290_0281030 david cohn how much money does it take to do this
ted_01114_0281310_0283010 ms 15 million dc okay
ted_01114_0283420_0290950 john kamen i think that you &apos;re going to have a hard time meeting with them but i think it &apos;s certainly worth pursuing a couple big really obvious brands
ted_01114_0290960_0295250 xk who knows maybe by the time your film comes out we look like a bunch of blithering idiots
ted_01114_0295260_0297350 ms what do you think the response is going to be
ted_01114_0297520_0299850 stuart ruderfer the responses mostly will be no
ted_01114_0300390_0302570 ms but is it a tough sell because of the film or a tough sell because of me
ted_01114_0303490_0304530 jk both
ted_01114_0304760_0307400 ms meaning not so optimistic
ted_01114_0309250_0311140 so sir can you help me i need help
ted_01114_0311700_0312160 mk i can help you
ted_01114_0312510_0315940 ms okay mk good awesome
ted_01114_0315950_0318400 mk we &apos;ve gotta figure out which brands
ted_01114_0318700_0323510 ms yeah mk that &apos;s the challenge when you look at the people you deal with
ted_01114_0323510_0328310 mk we &apos;ve got some places we can go ms okay turn the camera off
ted_01114_0328310_0335120 ms i thought turn the camera off meant let &apos;s have an offtherecord conversation turns out it really means we want nothing to do with your movie
ted_01114_0335510_0342390 ms and just like that one by one all of these companies suddenly disappeared
ted_01114_0343120_0348360 none of them wanted anything to do with this movie i was amazed they wanted absolutely nothing to do with this project
ted_01114_0348360_0355960 and i was blown away because i thought the whole concept the idea of advertising was to get your product out in front of as many people as possible to get as many people to see it as possible
ted_01114_0356150_0368850 especially in today &apos;s world this intersection of new media and old media and the fractured media landscape isn &apos;t the idea to get that new buzzworthy delivery vehicle that &apos;s going to get that message to the masses
ted_01114_0369860_0370810 no that &apos;s what i thought
ted_01114_0371340_0379860 but the problem was you see my idea had one fatal flaw and that flaw was this
ted_01114_0381350_0382880 actually no that was not the flaw whatsoever
ted_01114_0382880_0384070 that wouldn &apos;t have been a problem at all
ted_01114_0385630_0386540 this would have been fine
ted_01114_0386540_0388640 but what this image represents was the problem
ted_01114_0388650_0399780 see when you do a google image search for transparency this is laughter applause this is one of the first images that comes up
ted_01114_0400060_0402670 so i like the way you roll sergey brin
ted_01114_0403240_0424710 no laughter this is was the problem transparency free from pretense or deceit easily detected or seen through readily understood characterized by visibility or accessibility of information especially concerning business practices that last line being probably the biggest problem
ted_01114_0425130_0427200 you see we hear a lot about transparency these days
ted_01114_0427280_0431960 our politicians say it our president says it even our ceo &apos;s say it
ted_01114_0432440_0454320 but suddenly when it comes down to becoming a reality something suddenly changes but why well transparency is scary roar like that odd stillscreaming bear laughter it &apos;s unpredictable music laughter like this odd country road
ted_01114_0455640_0464140 and it &apos;s also very risky laughter what else is risky
ted_01114_0464210_0473570 eating an entire bowl of cool whip laughter that &apos;s very risky
ted_01114_0475490_0482200 now when i started talking to companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story and they said no we want you to tell a story
ted_01114_0482420_0497350 we want you to tell a story but we just want to tell our story see when i was a kid and my father would catch me in some sort of a lie and there he is giving me the look he often gave me he would say son there &apos;s three sides to every story
ted_01114_0498060_0507510 there &apos;s your story there &apos;s my story and there &apos;s the real story now you see with this film we wanted to tell the real story
ted_01114_0507510_0520930 but with only one company one agency willing to help me and that &apos;s only because i knew john bond and richard kirshenbaum for years i realized that i would have to go on my own i &apos;d have to cut out the middleman and go to the companies myself with all of my team
ted_01114_0520970_0529530 so what you suddenly started to realize or what i started to realize is that when you started having conversations with these companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem
ted_01114_0529740_0534360 video ms i have friends who make great big giant hollywood films and i have friends who make little independent films like i make
ted_01114_0534710_0541220 and the friends of mine who make big giant hollywood movies say the reason their films are so successful is because of the brand partners that they have
ted_01114_0541330_0553210 and then my friends who make small independent films say well how are we supposed to compete with these big giant hollywood movies and the movie is called the greatest movie ever sold so how specifically will we see ban in the film
ted_01114_0554000_0558950 any time i &apos;m ready to go any time i open up my medicine cabinet you will see ban deodorant
ted_01114_0559360_0566630 while anytime i do an interview with someone i can say are you fresh enough for this interview are you ready you look a little nervous
ted_01114_0566930_0568040 i want to help you calm down
ted_01114_0568040_0573300 so maybe you should put some one before the interview so we &apos;ll offer one of these fabulous scents
ted_01114_0573300_0576520 whether it &apos;s a floral fusion or a paradise winds they &apos;ll have their chance
ted_01114_0576940_0581870 we will have them geared for both male or female solid rollon or stick whatever it may be
ted_01114_0582770_0584340 that &apos;s the twocent tour
ted_01114_0585300_0588860 so now i can answer any of your questions and give you the fivecent tour
ted_01114_0588940_0589990 karen frank we are a smaller brand
ted_01114_0589990_0594870 much like you talked about being a smaller movie we &apos;re very much a challenger brand
ted_01114_0594880_0597100 so we don &apos;t have the budgets that other brands have
ted_01114_0597110_0602600 so doing things like this you know remind people about ban is kind of why were interested in it
ted_01114_0602760_0606130 ms what are the words that you would use to describe ban ban is blank
ted_01114_0620200_0622760 man we talk about bold fresh
ted_01114_0623140_0631020 i think fresh is a great word that really spins this category into the positive versus fights odor and wetness it keeps you fresh
ted_01114_0631020_0635190 how do we keep you fresher longer better freshness more freshness three times fresher
ted_01114_0635210_0638070 things like that that are more of that positive benefit
ted_01114_0638080_0643740 ms and that &apos;s a multimillion dollar corporation what about me what about a regular guy
ted_01114_0643770_0647230 i need to go talk to the man on the street the people who are like me the regular joes
ted_01114_0647260_0649080 they need to tell me about my brand
ted_01114_0649470_0651570 video ms how would you guys describe your brand
ted_01114_0651570_0660910 man um my brand i don &apos;t know i like really nice clothes
ted_01114_0660910_0666380 woman 80 &apos;s revival meets skaterpunk unless it &apos;s laundry day
ted_01114_0666400_0667850 ms all right what is brand gerry
ted_01114_0668800_0670220 gerry unique ms unique
ted_01114_0670270_0675850 man i guess what kind of genre style i am would be like dark glamor
ted_01114_0676020_0679500 i like a lot of black colors a lot of grays and stuff like that
ted_01114_0679500_0685970 but usually i have an accessory like sunglasses or i like crystal and things like that too
ted_01114_0686830_0692790 woman if dan were a brand he might be a classic convertible mercedes benz
ted_01114_0692790_0697980 man 2 the brand that i am is i would call it casual fly
ted_01114_0697990_0702310 woman 2 part hippie part yogi part brooklyn girl i don &apos;t know
ted_01114_0702320_0703200 man 3 i &apos;m the pet guy
ted_01114_0703370_0706320 i sell pet toys all over the country all over the world
ted_01114_0706330_0707590 so i guess that &apos;s my brand
ted_01114_0707590_0710840 in my warped little industry that &apos;s my brand
ted_01114_0711270_0713990 man 4 my brand is fedex because i deliver the goods
ted_01114_0714090_0717830 man 5 failed writeralcoholic brand is that something
ted_01114_0718510_0724920 tom i &apos;m tom
ted_01114_0724940_0732430 ms well we can &apos;t all be brand tom but i do often find myself at the intersection of dark glamor and casual fly
ted_01114_0734850_0736470 and what i realized is i needed an expert
ted_01114_0736490_0744960 i needed somebody who could get inside my head somebody who could really help me understand what they call your brand personality and so i found a company called olson zaltman in pittsburg
ted_01114_0745240_0749960 they &apos;ve helped companies like nestle febreze hallmark discover that brand personality
ted_01114_0749990_0752270 if they could do it for them surely they could do it for me
ted_01114_0753070_0754160 video abigail you brought your pictures right
ted_01114_0754340_0758550 ms i did the very first picture is a picture of my family
ted_01114_0758770_0761310 a so tell me a little bit how it relates to your thoughts and feelings about who you are
ted_01114_0761810_0764290 ms these are the people who shape the way i look at the world
ted_01114_0764290_0765690 a tell me about this world
ted_01114_0766800_0773490 ms this world i think your world is the world that you live in like people who are around you your friends your family the way you live your life the job you do
ted_01114_0774050_0778670 all those things stemmed and started from one place and for me they stemmed and started with my family in west virginia
ted_01114_0780150_0782560 ms the next one this was the best day ever
ted_01114_0782570_0784460 a how does this relate to your thoughts and feelings about who you are
ted_01114_0784880_0786320 ms it &apos;s like who do i want to be
ted_01114_0786600_0787660 i like things that are different
ted_01114_0787850_0789180 i like things that are weird
ted_01114_0789690_0790960 i like weird things
ted_01114_0790980_0793260 a tell me about the why phase what does that do for us
ted_01114_0793350_0794060 what is the machete
ted_01114_0794090_0795470 what pupa stage are you in now
ted_01114_0796410_0797760 what does the red represent
ted_01114_0798190_0802090 tell me a little bit about that part
ted_01114_0802670_0803890 what are some other metamorphoses that you &apos;ve had
ted_01114_0804370_0805050 doesn &apos;t have to be fear
ted_01114_0805330_0808670 ms eeeeee a thank you no thank you
ted_01114_0809200_0810170 a thanks for you patience ms great job
ted_01114_0810170_0811910 a yeah ms thanks a lot all right
ted_01114_0812180_0814830 ms yeah i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to come of this
ted_01114_0815410_0817170 there was a whole lot of crazy going on in there
ted_01114_0817690_0827830 lindsay zaltman the first thing we saw was this idea that you had two distinct but complementary sides to your brand personality the morgan spurlock brand is a mindful play brand
ted_01114_0828060_0830480 those are juxtaposed very nicely together
ted_01114_0830480_0832230 and i think there &apos;s almost a paradox with those
ted_01114_0832230_0838650 and i think some companies will just focus on one of their strengths or the other instead of focusing on both
ted_01114_0838680_0850210 most companies tend to and it &apos;s human nature to avoid things that they &apos;re not sure of avoid fear those elements and you really embrace those and you actually turn them into positives for you and it &apos;s a neat thing to see
ted_01114_0850240_0851490 what other brands are like that
ted_01114_0851970_0853980 the first on here is the classic apple
ted_01114_0854360_0860470 and you can see here too target wii mini from the mini coopers and jetblue
ted_01114_0860530_0867540 now there &apos;s playful brands and mindful brands those things that have come and gone but a playful mindful brand is a pretty powerful thing
ted_01114_0867930_0869460 ms a playful mindful brand
ted_01114_0869460_0870180 what is your brand
ted_01114_0870180_0873840 if somebody asked you to describe your brand identity your brand personality what would you be
ted_01114_0874170_0875510 are you an up attribute
ted_01114_0875840_0877950 are you something that gets the blood flowing
ted_01114_0878310_0879680 or are you more of a down attribute
ted_01114_0879680_0882770 are you something that &apos;s a little more calm reserved conservative
ted_01114_0883150_0897270 up attributes are things like being playful being fresh like the fresh prince contemporary adventurous edgy or daring like errol flynn nimble or agile profane domineering magical or mystical like gandalf
ted_01114_0898020_0899490 or are you more of a down attribute
ted_01114_0899850_0902080 are you mindful sophisticated like 007
ted_01114_0902080_0906700 are you established traditional nurturing protective empathetic like the oprah
ted_01114_0907170_0915250 are you reliable stable familiar safe secure sacred contemplative or wise like the dalai lama or yoda
ted_01114_0916180_0923930 over the course of this film we had 500plus companies who were up and down companies saying no they didn &apos;t want any part of this project
ted_01114_0923930_0928750 they wanted nothing to do with this film mainly because they would have no control they would have no control over the final product
ted_01114_0928750_0945330 but we did get 17 brand partners who were willing to relinquish that control who wanted to be in business with someone as mindful and as playful as myself and who ultimately empowered us to tell stories that normally we wouldn &apos;t be able to tell stories that an advertiser would normally never get behind
ted_01114_0946070_0957670 they enabled us to tell the story about neuromarketing as we got into telling the story in this film about how now they &apos;re using mri &apos;s to target the desire centers of your brain for both commercials as well as movie marketing
ted_01114_0958230_0960970 we went to san paulo where they have banned outdoor advertising
ted_01114_0960970_0973640 in the entire city for the past five years there &apos;s no billboards there &apos;s no posters there &apos;s no flyers nothing applause and we went to school districts where now companies are making their way into cashstrapped schools all across america
ted_01114_0975550_0981880 what &apos;s incredible for me is the projects that i &apos;ve gotten the most feedback out of or i &apos;ve had the most success in are ones where i &apos;ve interacted with things directly
ted_01114_0981880_0988940 and that &apos;s what these brands did they cut out the middleman they cut out their agencies and said maybe these agencies don &apos;t have my best interest in mind
ted_01114_0989280_0991120 i &apos;m going to deal directly with the artist
ted_01114_0991340_0996630 i &apos;m going to work with him to create something different something that &apos;s going to get people thinking that &apos;s going to challenge the way we look at the world
ted_01114_0997110_1002470 and how has that been for them has it been successful well since the film premiered at the sundance film festival let &apos;s take a look
ted_01114_1002760_1010440 according to burrelles the movie premiered in january and since then and this isn &apos;t even the whole thing we &apos;ve had 900 million media impressions for this film
ted_01114_1010730_1012800 that &apos;s literally covering just like a two and a halfweek period
ted_01114_1012800_1015170 that &apos;s only online no print no tv
ted_01114_1015390_1016870 the film hasn &apos;t even been distributed yet
ted_01114_1016870_1021310 it &apos;s not even online it &apos;s not even streaming it &apos;s not even been out into other foreign countries yet
ted_01114_1021880_1026300 so ultimately this film has already started to gain a lot of momentum
ted_01114_1026610_1031640 and not bad for a project that almost every ad agency we talked to advised their clients not to take part
ted_01114_1032570_1038230 what i always believe is that if you take chances if you take risks that in those risks will come opportunity
ted_01114_1038620_1042630 i believe that when you push people away from that you &apos;re pushing them more towards failure
ted_01114_1043370_1049730 i believe that when you train your employees to be risk averse then you &apos;re preparing your whole company to be reward challenged
ted_01114_1050450_1055010 i feel like that what has to happen moving forward is we need to encourage people to take risks
ted_01114_1055340_1058810 we need to encourage people to not be afraid of opportunities that may scare them
ted_01114_1059190_1062170 ultimately moving forward i think we have to embrace fear
ted_01114_1062660_1078000 we &apos;ve got to put that bear in a cage laughter embrace fear embrace risk one big spoonful at a time we have to embrace risk
ted_01114_1078000_1080900 and ultimately we have to embrace transparency
ted_01114_1082580_1086320 today more than ever a little honesty is going to go a long way
ted_01114_1086320_1116320 and that being said through honesty and transparency my entire talk embrace transparency has been brought to you by my good friends at emc who for 7100 bought the naming rights on ebay applause emc turning big data into big opportunity for organizations all over the world
ted_01114_1116320_1119120 emc presents embrace transparency
ted_01114_1119130_1120650 thank you very much guys
ted_01114_1127840_1141710 june cohen so morgan in the name of transparency what exactly happened to that 7100
ted_01114_1142400_1143610 ms that is a fantastic question
ted_01114_1144860_1156020 i have in my pocket a check made out to the parent organization to the ted organization the sapling foundation a check for 7100 to be applied toward my attendance for next year &apos;s ted
ted_01114_1155990_1156190 laughter
ted_01115_0016160_0020260 i have had the distinct blessing in my life to have worked on a bunch of amazing projects
ted_01115_0020260_0025010 but the coolest i ever worked on was around this guy
ted_01115_0025080_0026200 this guy &apos;s name is tempt
ted_01115_0026650_0029660 tempt was one of the foremost graffiti artists in the 80s
ted_01115_0030050_0035220 and he came up home from a run one day and said dad my legs are tingling and that was the onset of als
ted_01115_0035830_0038030 so tempt is now completely paralyzed
ted_01115_0038030_0040370 he only has use of his eyes
ted_01115_0040830_0049290 i was exposed to him i have a company that does design and animation so obviously graffiti is definitely an intricate part of what we admire and respect in the art world
ted_01115_0050040_0054240 and so we decided that we were going to sponsor tony tempt and his cause
ted_01115_0054250_0064110 so i went and met with his brother and father and said we &apos;re going to give you this money what are you going to do with it and his brother said i just want to be able to talk to tony again
ted_01115_0064260_0081520 i just want to be able to communicate with him and him to be able to communicate with me and i said wait a second isn &apos;t that i &apos;ve seen stephen hawking don &apos;t all paralyzed people have the ability to communicate via these devices and he said no unless you &apos;re in the upper echelon and you &apos;ve got really amazing insurance you can &apos;t actually do that
ted_01115_0081550_0091300 these devices aren &apos;t accessible to people and i said well how do you actually communicate has everyone seen the movie the diving bell and the butterfly that &apos;s how they communicate so run their finger along
ted_01115_0091300_0092660 i said that &apos;s archaic
ted_01115_0092660_0093540 how can that be
ted_01115_0094060_0102950 so i showed up with the desire to just write a check and instead i wrote a check that i had no freaking idea how i was going to cash
ted_01115_0103700_0112350 i committed to his brother and his father right then and there i &apos;m like all right here &apos;s the deal tony &apos;s going to speak we &apos;re going to get him a machine and we &apos;re going to figure out a way for him to do his art again
ted_01115_0112370_0117280 because it &apos;s a travesty that someone who still has all of that in him isn &apos;t able to communicate it
ted_01115_0117920_0119980 so i spoke at a conference a couple months after that
ted_01115_0120330_0131910 i met these guys called grl graffiti research lab and they have a technology that allows them to project a light onto any surface and then with a laser pointer draw on it and it just registers the negative space
ted_01115_0131920_0134940 so they go around and do art installations like this
ted_01115_0135560_0137790 all the things that go up there they said there &apos;s a life cycle
ted_01115_0137870_0146650 first it starts with the sexual organs then it starts with cuss words then it was bush slanders and then people actually got to art
ted_01115_0146650_0148370 but there was always a life cycle to their presentations
ted_01115_0150210_0164020 so i went home and was having dinner with my wife and was telling her about this and we were like well wait a second if we know that this technology exists where you can use your eyes to control things why don &apos;t we figure out a way for tempt to control a laser and he could do graf again well that would be awesome
ted_01115_0164380_0165660 so that started the journey
ted_01115_0165740_0174990 and about two years later about a year later after a bunch of organization and a bunch of moving things around we &apos;d accomplished a couple things
ted_01115_0174990_0186470 one we battered down the doors of the insurance companies and we actually got tempt a machine that let him communicate a stephen hawking machine applause which was awesome
ted_01115_0186470_0193650 and he &apos;s seriously one of the funniest i call him yoda because you talk to the guy you get an email from him and you &apos;re like i &apos;m not worthy this guy &apos;s so amazing
ted_01115_0194240_0201180 the other thing we did is we flew seven programmers from all over the world literally every corner of the world into our house
ted_01115_0201540_0210020 my wife and kids and i moved to our back garage and these hackers and programmers and conspiracy theorists and anarchists took over our house
ted_01115_0210050_0216910 a lot of our friends thought we were absolutely stupid to do that and that we were going to come back and all the pictures on the wall would be removed and graf on the walls
ted_01115_0217730_0230360 but for over two weeks we programmed we went to the venice boardwalk my kids got involved my dog got involved and we created this
ted_01115_0230840_0234560 this is called the eyewriter and you can see the description
ted_01115_0235060_0243030 this is a cheap pair of sunglasses that we bought at the venice beach boardwalk some copper wire and some stuff from home depot and radio shack
ted_01115_0243630_0255080 we took a ps3 camera hacked it open mounted it to an led light and now there &apos;s a device that is free you build this yourself we publish the code for free you download the software for free
ted_01115_0255400_0259200 and now we &apos;ve created a device that has absolutely no limitations
ted_01115_0259450_0274340 there &apos;s no insurance company that can say no there &apos;s no hospital that can say no anybody who &apos;s paralyzed now has access to actually draw or communicate using only their eyes
ted_01115_0279430_0286200 thank you thank you guys very much that was awesome
ted_01115_0286860_0292590 so at the end of the two weeks we went back to tempt &apos;s room
ted_01115_0293000_0296020 i love this picture because this is someone else &apos;s room and that &apos;s his room
ted_01115_0296020_0308650 so there &apos;s all this hustle and bustle going on for the big unveiling and after over a year of planning two weeks of programming carbfest and allnight sessions tony drew again for the first time in seven years
ted_01115_0308960_0314810 and this is an amazing picture because this is his life support system and he &apos;s looking over his life support system
ted_01115_0314810_0316990 we kicked his bed so that he could see out
ted_01115_0317220_0321730 and we set up a projector on a wall out in the parking lot outside of his hospital
ted_01115_0321990_0329940 and he drew again for the first time in front of his family and friends and you can only imagine what the feeling in the parking lot was
ted_01115_0330070_0334370 the funny thing was we had to break into the parking lot too so we totally felt like we were legit in the whole graf scene too
ted_01115_0337010_0344670 so at the end of this he sent us an email and this is what the email said that was the first time i &apos;ve drawn anything for seven years
ted_01115_0345510_0352730 i feel like i had been held underwater and someone finally reached down and pulled my head up so i could breathe isn &apos;t that awesome
ted_01115_0355830_0356030 applause
ted_01115_0356220_0359110 so that &apos;s kind of our battle cry
ted_01115_0359160_0361650 that &apos;s what keeps us going and keeps us developing
ted_01115_0361650_0364200 and we &apos;ve got such a long way to go with this
ted_01115_0364800_0367780 this is an amazing device but it &apos;s the equivalent of an etch a sketch
ted_01115_0367790_0370940 and someone who has that kind of artistic potential deserves so much more
ted_01115_0370940_0375040 so we &apos;re in the process of trying to figure out how to make it better faster stronger
ted_01115_0375740_0378880 since that time we &apos;ve had all kinds of acknowledgment
ted_01115_0379180_0380370 we &apos;ve won a bunch of awards
ted_01115_0380460_0382810 remember it &apos;s free none of us are making any money on this thing
ted_01115_0382810_0383880 it &apos;s all coming out of our own pockets
ted_01115_0383890_0392700 so the awards were like oh this is fantastic armstrong twittered about us and then in december time magazine honored us as one of the top 50 inventions of 2010 which was really cool
ted_01115_0392645_0392845 applause
ted_01115_0395620_0415050 the coolest thing about this and this is what &apos;s completing the whole circle is that in april of this year at the geffen moca in downtown los angeles there &apos;s going to be an exhibition called art of the streets and art of the streets is going to have pretty much the badasses of the street art scene banksy shepard fairey kaws all of these guys will be there
ted_01115_0416310_0418980 tempt &apos;s going to be in the show which is pretty awesome
ted_01115_0421970_0429540 so basically this is my point if you see something that &apos;s not possible make it possible
ted_01115_0429790_0436640 everything in this room wasn &apos;t possible this stage this computer this mic the eyewriter wasn &apos;t possible at one point
ted_01115_0436950_0438780 make it possible everyone in this room
ted_01115_0438820_0447950 i &apos;m not a programmer never done anything with ocular recognition technology but i just recognized something and associated myself with amazing people so that we could make something happen
ted_01115_0448120_0455980 and this is the question i want everyone to ask yourself every single day when you come up with something you feel that needs to be done if not now then when
ted_01115_0456450_0457700 and if not me then who
ted_01115_0458360_0463230 thank you guys
ted_01131_0016180_0019000 how would you like to be better than you are
ted_01131_0020190_0029610 suppose i said that with just a few changes in your genes you could get a better memory more precise more accurate and quicker
ted_01131_0030570_0034640 or maybe you &apos;d like to be more fit stronger with more stamina
ted_01131_0035690_0038430 would you like to be more attractive and selfconfident
ted_01131_0039630_0042010 how about living longer with good health
ted_01131_0043210_0047520 or perhaps you &apos;re one of those who &apos;s always yearned for more creativity
ted_01131_0047680_0050300 which one would you like the most
ted_01131_0051960_0056530 which would you like if you could have just one audience member creativity creativity
ted_01131_0058000_0065820 how many people would choose creativity raise your hands let me see a few probably about as many as there are creative people here laughter that &apos;s very good
ted_01131_0067140_0068620 how many would opt for memory
ted_01131_0070700_0079010 quite a few more how about fitness a few less what about longevity ah the majority
ted_01131_0079010_0080890 that makes me feel very good as a doctor
ted_01131_0081660_0085940 if you could have any one of these it would be a very different world
ted_01131_0086500_0088500 is it just imaginary
ted_01131_0088990_0091610 or is it perhaps possible
ted_01131_0092360_0100970 evolution has been a perennial topic here at the ted conference but i want to give you today one doctor &apos;s take on the subject
ted_01131_0102180_0151190 the great 20thcentury geneticist tg dobzhansky who was also a communicant in the russian orthodox church once wrote an essay that he titled nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution now if you are one of those who does not accept the evidence for biological evolution this would be a very good time to turn off your hearing aid take out your personal communications device i give you permission and perhaps take another look at kathryn schultz &apos;s book on being wrong because nothing in the rest of this talk is going to make any sense whatsoever to you laughter but if you do accept biological evolution consider this is it just about the past or is it about the future
ted_01131_0151220_0156140 does it apply to others or does it apply to us
ted_01131_0156840_0159190 this is another look at the tree of life
ted_01131_0159770_0180000 in this picture i &apos;ve put a bush with a center branching out in all directions because if you look at the edges of the tree of life every existing species at the tips of those branches has succeeded in evolutionary terms it has survived it has demonstrated a fitness to its environment
ted_01131_0181340_0190260 the human part of this branch way out on one end is of course the one that we are most interested in
ted_01131_0190620_0197690 we branch off of a common ancestor to modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago
ted_01131_0198250_0204320 in the interval there have been perhaps 20 or 25 different species of hominids
ted_01131_0205170_0207240 some have come and gone
ted_01131_0207530_0211880 we have been here for about 130000 years
ted_01131_0211900_0224660 it may seem like we &apos;re quite remote from other parts of this tree of life but actually for the most part the basic machinery of our cells is pretty much the same
ted_01131_0224660_0235840 do you realize that we can take advantage and commandeer the machinery of a common bacterium to produce the protein of human insulin used to treat diabetics
ted_01131_0235890_0245320 this is not like human insulin this is the same protein that is chemically indistinguishable from what comes out of your pancreas
ted_01131_0246540_0256070 and speaking of bacteria do you realize that each of us carries in our gut more bacteria than there are cells in the rest of our body
ted_01131_0256380_0257690 maybe 10 times more
ted_01131_0258020_0264880 i mean think of it when antonio damasio asks about your selfimage do you think about the bacteria
ted_01131_0266780_0270690 our gut is a wonderfully hospitable environment for those bacteria
ted_01131_0270700_0274300 it &apos;s warm it &apos;s dark it &apos;s moist it &apos;s very cozy
ted_01131_0274600_0278950 and you &apos;re going to provide all the nutrition that they could possibly want with no effort on their part
ted_01131_0278950_0287110 it &apos;s really like an easy street for bacteria with the occasional interruption of the unintended forced rush to the exit
ted_01131_0287130_0296260 but otherwise you are a wonderful environment for those bacteria just as they are essential to your life
ted_01131_0296290_0301990 they help in the digestion of essential nutrients and they protect you against certain diseases
ted_01131_0303300_0305260 but what will come in the future
ted_01131_0305340_0309880 are we at some kind of evolutionary equipoise as a species
ted_01131_0309950_0318480 or are we destined to become something different something perhaps even better adapted to the environment
ted_01131_0319500_0348340 now let &apos;s take a step back in time to the big bang 14 billion years ago the earth the solar system about four and a half billion years the first signs of protolife maybe three to four billion years ago on earth the first multicelled organisms perhaps as much as 800 or a billion years ago and then the human species finally emerging in the last 130000 years
ted_01131_0348620_0370440 in this vast unfinished symphony of the universe life on earth is like a brief measure the animal kingdom like a single measure and human life a small grace note that was us that also constitutes the entertainment portion of this talk so i hope you enjoyed it
ted_01131_0372500_0377860 now when i was a freshman in college i took my first biology class
ted_01131_0378210_0382420 i was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology
ted_01131_0382480_0399390 i became enamored of the power of evolution and i realized something very fundamental in most of the existence of life in singlecelled organisms each cell simply divides and all of the genetic energy of that cell is carried on in both daughter cells
ted_01131_0399810_0405500 but at the time multicelled organisms come online things start to change
ted_01131_0405610_0408430 sexual reproduction enters the picture
ted_01131_0409330_0419280 and very importantly with the introduction of sexual reproduction that passes on the genome the rest of the body becomes expendable
ted_01131_0419630_0431370 in fact you could say that the inevitability of the death of our bodies enters in evolutionary time at the same moment as sexual reproduction
ted_01131_0432040_0446910 now i have to confess when i was a college undergraduate i thought okay sex death sex death death for sex it seemed pretty reasonable at the time but with each passing year i &apos;ve come to have increasing doubts
ted_01131_0446910_0453230 i &apos;ve come to understand the sentiments of george burns who was performing still in las vegas well into his 90s
ted_01131_0453510_0456110 and one night there &apos;s a knock at his hotel room door
ted_01131_0456110_0457200 he answers the door
ted_01131_0457360_0461190 standing before him is a gorgeous scantily clad showgirl
ted_01131_0461400_0468520 she looks at him and says i &apos;m here for super sex that &apos;s fine says george i &apos;ll take the soup
ted_01131_0470800_0471000 laughter
ted_01131_0472910_0485930 i came to realize as a physician that i was working toward a goal which was different from the goal of evolution not necessarily contradictory just different
ted_01131_0485940_0487960 i was trying to preserve the body
ted_01131_0488090_0489990 i wanted to keep us healthy
ted_01131_0490020_0492610 i wanted to restore health from disease
ted_01131_0492630_0495470 i wanted us to live long and healthy lives
ted_01131_0495590_0506180 evolution is all about passing on the genome to the next generation adapting and surviving through generation after generation
ted_01131_0506420_0517400 from an evolutionary point of view you and i are like the booster rockets designed to send the genetic payload into the next level of orbit and then drop off into the sea
ted_01131_0517740_0524720 i think we would all understand the sentiment that woody allen expressed when he said i don &apos;t want to achieve immortality through my work
ted_01131_0524730_0526920 i want to achieve it through not dying
ted_01131_0530030_0534110 evolution does not necessarily favor the longestlived
ted_01131_0534590_0540290 it doesn &apos;t necessarily favor the biggest or the strongest or the fastest and not even the smartest
ted_01131_0540300_0547490 evolution favors those creatures best adapted to their environment
ted_01131_0547790_0569620 that is the sole test of survival and success at the bottom of the ocean bacteria that are thermophilic and can survive at the steam vent heat that would otherwise produce if fish were there sousvide cooked fish nevertheless have managed to make that a hospitable environment for them
ted_01131_0570430_0592440 so what does this mean as we look back at what has happened in evolution and as we think about the place again of humans in evolution and particularly as we look ahead to the next phase i would say that there are a number of possibilities
ted_01131_0592910_0597140 the first is that we will not evolve
ted_01131_0598030_0601020 we have reached a kind of equipoise
ted_01131_0601650_0612540 and the reasoning behind that would be first we have through medicine managed to preserve a lot of genes that would otherwise be selected out and be removed from the population
ted_01131_0612790_0634890 and secondly we as a species have so configured our environment that we have managed to make it adapt to us as well as we adapt to it and by the way we immigrate and circulate and intermix so much that you can &apos;t any longer have the isolation that is necessary for evolution to take place
ted_01131_0635560_0644300 a second possibility is that there will be evolution of the traditional kind natural imposed by the forces of nature
ted_01131_0645000_0651940 and the argument here would be that the wheels of evolution grind slowly but they are inexorable
ted_01131_0652570_0664880 and as far as isolation goes when we as a species do colonize distant planets there will be the isolation and the environmental changes that could produce evolution in the natural way
ted_01131_0665620_0684600 but there &apos;s a third possibility an enticing intriguing and frightening possibility i call it neoevolution the new evolution that is not simply natural but guided and chosen by us as individuals in the choices that we will make
ted_01131_0685320_0687390 now how could this come about
ted_01131_0687950_0690390 how could it be possible that we would do this
ted_01131_0690610_0699660 consider first the reality that people today in some cultures are making choices about their offspring
ted_01131_0700120_0704270 they &apos;re in some cultures choosing to have more males than females
ted_01131_0704710_0709930 it &apos;s not necessarily good for the society but it &apos;s what the individual and the family are choosing
ted_01131_0711510_0728200 think also if it were possible ever for you to choose not simply to choose the sex of your child but for you in your body to make the genetic adjustments that would cure or prevent diseases
ted_01131_0728200_0737470 what if you could make the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate stroke
ted_01131_0737540_0743280 wouldn &apos;t you want to make those changes in your genes
ted_01131_0744230_0751790 if we look ahead these kind of changes are going to be increasingly possible
ted_01131_0752730_0759010 the human genome project started in 1990 and it took 13 years
ted_01131_0759330_0762590 it cost 27 billion dollars
ted_01131_0764030_0771470 the year after it was finished in 2004 you could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three to four months
ted_01131_0771980_0781050 today you can have a complete sequence of the three billion base pairs in the human genome at a cost of about 20000 dollars and in the space of about a week
ted_01131_0781790_0790800 it won &apos;t be very long before the reality will be the 1000dollar human genome and it will be increasingly available for everyone
ted_01131_0791870_0842490 just a week ago the national academy of engineering awarded its draper prize to francis arnold and willem stemmer two scientists who independently developed techniques to encourage the natural process of evolution to work faster and to lead to desirable proteins in a more efficient way what frances arnold calls directed evolution a couple of years ago the lasker prize was awarded to the scientist shinya yamanaka for his research in which he took an adult skin cell a fibroblast and by manipulating just four genes he induced that cell to revert to a pluripotential stem cell a cell potentially capable of becoming any cell in your body
ted_01131_0842940_0856000 these changes are coming the same technology that has produced the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that will not only protect you against themselves but induce immunity against other viruses
ted_01131_0856160_0866090 believe it or not there &apos;s an experimental trial going on with vaccine against influenza that has been grown in the cells of a tobacco plant
ted_01131_0866990_0869360 can you imagine something good coming out of tobacco
ted_01131_0870660_0876760 these are all reality today and in the future will be evermore possible
ted_01131_0876960_0881300 imagine then just two other little changes
ted_01131_0881500_0887410 you can change the cells in your body but what if you could change the cells in your offspring
ted_01131_0887530_0900770 what if you could change the sperm and the ova or change the newly fertilized egg and give your offspring a better chance at a healthier life eliminate the diabetes eliminate the hemophilia reduce the risk of cancer
ted_01131_0900960_0903010 who doesn &apos;t want healthier children
ted_01131_0903580_0922800 and then that same analytic technology that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent disease will also enable us to adopt superattributes hypercapacities that better memory
ted_01131_0922800_0930470 why not have the quick wit of a ken jennings especially if you can augment it with the next generation of the watson machine
ted_01131_0931220_0936510 why not have the quick twitch muscle that will enable you to run faster and longer
ted_01131_0937220_0939810 why not live longer
ted_01131_0940620_0942620 these will be irresistible
ted_01131_0943160_0957850 and when we are at a position where we can pass it on to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes we want we will have converted oldstyle evolution into neoevolution
ted_01131_0957860_0967690 we &apos;ll take a process that normally might require 100000 years and we can compress it down to a thousand years and maybe even in the next 100 years
ted_01131_0968480_0975990 these are choices that your grandchildren or their grandchildren are going to have before them
ted_01131_0976720_0985420 will we use these choices to make a society that is better that is more successful that is kinder
ted_01131_0985700_0992970 or will we selectively choose different attributes that we want for some of us and not for others of us
ted_01131_0993350_1001700 will we make a society that is more boring and more uniform or more robust and more versatile
ted_01131_1001980_1005560 these are the kinds of questions that we will have to face
ted_01131_1005560_1016140 and most profoundly of all will we ever be able to develop the wisdom and to inherit the wisdom that we &apos;ll need to make these choices wisely
ted_01131_1016160_1022930 for better or worse and sooner than you may think these choices will be up to us
ted_01131_1023450_1034930 thank you
ted_01137_0016260_0042520 good afternoon everybody i &apos;ve got something to show you laughter think about this as a pixel a flying pixel
ted_01137_0043350_0046350 this is what we call in our lab sensible design
ted_01137_0046460_0047510 let me tell you a bit about it
ted_01137_0047930_0062100 now if you take this picture i &apos;m italian originally and every boy in italy grows up with this picture on the wall of his bedroom but the reason i &apos;m showing you this is that something very interesting happened in formula 1 racing over the past couple of decades
ted_01137_0062610_0070720 now some time ago if you wanted to win a formula 1 race you take a budget and you bet your budget on a good driver and a good car
ted_01137_0071270_0074420 and if the car and the driver were good enough then you &apos;d win the race
ted_01137_0074790_0098240 now today if you want to win the race actually you need also something like this something that monitors the car in real time has a few thousand sensors collecting information from the car transmitting this information into the system and then processing it and using it in order to go back to the car with decisions and changing things in real time as information is collected
ted_01137_0098750_0103420 this is what in engineering terms you would call a real time control system
ted_01137_0103600_0109170 and basically it &apos;s a system made of two components a sensing and an actuating component
ted_01137_0109670_0115600 what is interesting today is that real time control systems are starting to enter into our lives
ted_01137_0115960_0122500 our cities over the past few years just have been blanketed with networks electronics
ted_01137_0122700_0124970 they &apos;re becoming like computers in open air
ted_01137_0125370_0131640 and as computers in open air they &apos;re starting to respond in a different way to be able to be sensed and to be actuated
ted_01137_0132120_0134060 if we fix cities actually it &apos;s a big deal
ted_01137_0134080_0142090 just as an aside i wanted to mention cities are only two percent of the earth &apos;s crust but they are 50 percent of the world &apos;s population
ted_01137_0142390_0148280 they are 75 percent of the energy consumption up to 80 percent of co2 emissions
ted_01137_0148690_0151610 so if we &apos;re able to do something with cities that &apos;s a big deal
ted_01137_0152130_0158460 beyond cities all of this sensing and actuating is entering our everyday objects
ted_01137_0158950_0165030 that &apos;s from an exhibition that paola antonelli is organizing at moma later this year during the summer
ted_01137_0165030_0169990 it &apos;s called talk to me well our objects our environment is starting to talk back to us
ted_01137_0170270_0176480 in a certain sense it &apos;s almost as if every atom out there were becoming both a sensor and an actuator
ted_01137_0176730_0182280 and that is radically changing the interaction we have as humans with the environment out there
ted_01137_0182550_0198230 in a certain sense it &apos;s almost as if the old dream of michelangelo you know when michelangelo sculpted the moses at the end it said that he took the hammer threw it at the moses actually you can still see a small chip underneath and said shouted perché non parli
ted_01137_0198380_0203390 why don &apos;t you talk well today for the first time our environment is starting to talk back to us
ted_01137_0204140_0209760 and i &apos;ll show just a few examples again with this idea of sensing our environment and actuating it
ted_01137_0210890_0216410 well the first project i wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects by our lab
